# Tapir Protocol Contributions

This repo showcases my work on Tapir Protocol, a Web3 project. I contributed to:
- Next.js frontend (refactoring, UI/UX, data fetching, split functionality, meta tags, tooltips, layout).
- Smart contract integration.
- GitBook docs, deployment on Vercel.

**Context**:
I worked 3 months but was unpaid ($2000/month), removed from Slack/GitHub, and abused by the team lead. After multiple failed attempts to resolve this, Iâ€™m open-sourcing my work.
